}
\arguments{
\item{location}{location from WPP 2019 data}

\item{years}{years to retrieve estimation of qx (numeric)}

\item{sex}{female, male or both}

\item{age_inf}{lower bound age of estimation}

\item{age_sup}{upper_bound age of estimation}
}
\value{
data.frame with 3 columns, years of estimation, age_interval, qx
}
\description{

}
\examples{

# q0_5 for Mexico for periods 0-4, 5-9 and 10-14 before 2010
q_calcWpp2019( location = 'Mexico',
               years = 2010 - c( 2.5, 7.5, 12.5 ),
