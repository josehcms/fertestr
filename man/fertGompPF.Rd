\arguments{
\item{ages}{A vector of starting ages of five-year age groups ranging from 15 to 45 (default = c(15,20,25,30,35,40,45))}

\item{asfr}{A vector of age-specific fertility rates by five-year age group - same groups as 'ages'}

\item{P}{A vector of mean parities by five-year age group - same groups as 'ages'}

\item{level}{TRUE for correction of fertility level using parity data information, false for correction of fertility shape only}

\item{madef}{Mother's age definition: '0m' for age at birth of child, '12m' for age at survey for 12 months data (default),
'24m' for age at survey for 24 months data, '36m' for age at survey for 36 months data}

\item{sel.ages}{select ages for curve fitting}

\item{plot.diagnostic}{plot diagnostic graph}
}
\value{
A list with 3 elements:
pf_data data frame with columns ages, P for mean parities, asfr, Fi for cumulate fertility estimated from Brass coefficients,PF for ratios P/F and adj_asfr for adjusted asfr;
tfr_unadj for unadjusted total fertility rate estimate;
and tfr_adj for adjusted total fertility rate estimate by applying the selected age-group PF ratio
