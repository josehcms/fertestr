\usage{
fertBrassPF.cltrss(
  ages = seq(15, 45, 5),
  P,
  asfr,
  adjust_group = c(20),
  age_shift = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ages}{A vector of starting ages of five-year age groups ranging from 15 to 45 (default = c(15,20,25,30,35,40,45))}

\item{P}{A vector of mean parities by five-year age group - same groups as 'ages'}

\item{asfr}{A vector of age-specific fertility rates by five-year age group - same groups as 'ages'}

\item{adjust_group}{A vector of age-groups from 'ages' to be used for selection of PF ratios to adjust asfr data
(default set to 20 (20-24 five-year age group))}

\item{age_shift}{TRUE (default) if fertility rates are calculated from births in a 12-month period
by age of mothed at the end of period and FALSE if fertility rates are calculated from births by
age of mother at the end of the period}
}
\value{
A list with 3 elements:
pf_data data frame with columns ages, P for mean parities, asfr, Fi for cumulate fertility estimated from Brass coefficients,PF for ratios P/F and adj_asfr for adjusted asfr;
tfr_unadj for unadjusted total fertility rate estimate;
and tfr_adj for adjusted total fertility rate estimate by applying the selected age-group PF ratio
